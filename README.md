## Git branches and development
The default branch in the Github repo is `development`. However, releases are cut from the `main` branch. In general, PRs should be made against the `development` branch and reviewed by at least one other person before being merged. When ready for a release, a PR should be made from `development` to `main` and reviewed. Once happy with the PR, it can be merged and then a [release can be drafted for distribution](#automatic-github-distribution).

## Install

```bash
yarn
```

The application is using [libnspv](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/libnspv).

Install the following dependencies for `libnspv` to work. Eventually it will be included and packaged with the app.

### Mac OS

```
# Install brew
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
# Install Xcode, opens a pop-up window to install CLT without installing the entire Xcode package
xcode-select --install
# Update brew and install dependencies
brew update
brew upgrade
brew install libsodium libevent automake libtool git wget
```

### Linux

```
sudo apt-get -y install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 autoconf \
libtool unzip git wget automake
```

## Starting Development

Start the app in the `dev` environment:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Packaging for Production

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
yarn package
```

## Automatic Github Distribution
The `tokel_app` project has a Github Action which allows builds for Linux/Mac/Windows to be automatically built and attached as assets to a Github Release. The process is as follows:
1. Push commits as normal to Github
2. Merge `development` into `main`
3. Create a new **pre-release** release in [Releases](/TokelPlatform/tokel_app/releases). **Important**: the pre-release needs to be tagged with the same version number in `src/electron/package.json`, but with a `v` prepended. So if the version in `package.json` is `0.5.1`, the release should be tagged as `v0.5.1` (the release name can be whatever you want).
4. Creating a pre-release will trigger the `publish` Github Action, which in turn uses [Electron Builder](/electron-userland/electron-builder) to automatically build distributables for Linux/Mac/Windows and attach them to the previously created pre-release (this is why the release tag matching the package version is important).
5. Once the Github Action completes, the platform-specific packages can be downloaded/test. Once happy, change the release from a pre-release to **released**.
